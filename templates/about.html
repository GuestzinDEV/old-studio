        Old Studio is a small Brazilian game development team focused on creating experiences for the Roblox platform.

    <h2 class="title-blue">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our main goal is to bring back the nostalgic feeling of playing Roblox during the years 2006–2007,
        while also delivering high-quality and well-crafted games for modern players.
    </p>

<div class="box">
    <h2 class="title-blue">Game Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        All of our games are completely <strong>free to play</strong>. Players do not need to spend Robux
        in order to fully enjoy our experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        We strongly value storytelling and attention to detail. Each game we create has a background story,
        and some of our projects take place within the same shared universe.
